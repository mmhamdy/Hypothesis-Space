Hello👋, and welcome to Hypothesis Space 🌌

I'm Mohammed Hamdy. I live in Cairo, Egypt. For the most part of my professional career I've been working as a preclinical research scientist. I've been studying machine learning for a while now, and in this blog I intend to write about things that I find interesting in the field, or some useful programming tips that I've stumbled upon, or even just my thoughts on different matters.

In machine learning, I'm particularly interested in neural network compression, continual learning, and self-supervised learning. A field that I find really promising and hope to get a chance to read more about someday is graph neural networks.

I'm also interested in the applications of machine learning and natural language processing in biology. Specifically, I'm interested in protein and genomics language models.

Things that I enjoy doing include:

-   Reading 📚: I enjoy reading all sorts of books, but my favorite genres are science fiction and philosophy. My favorite science fiction novels are: *Consider Phlebas*, and *The Metamrphosis of Prime Intellect.* Two novels in which we live in harmony with AI (sort of).

-   Aimless walking 🚶 and weird discussions with friends.

-   Watching and talking about films 🎥. My favorite film directors are: Coen Brothers, Tim Burton, and Werner Herzog.

-   Eating Pizza 🍕

**Trivia Time**: In Antarctica, there is a mountain named Mount Hypothesis in appreciation of the role of hypothesis in scientific research.
